OBITUARY MANAGEMENT PLATFORM: 
This project outlines the development of a web application for submitting, managing, and displaying obituaries. It offers user-friendly interfaces for both creating and viewing obituaries, and incorporates Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Social Media Optimization (SMO) features to maximize visibility and engagement.

Getting Started:
This project utilizes a web framework of your choice (Django, Node.js, Laravel, or Flask) and a relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).

Prerequisites:

Local development environment with your chosen framework installed
Database management tool
Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

.Obituary_form.html:This file contains the HTML form for submitting obituary information.
.Submit_obituary (script): This script handles form submissions, captures data, stores it in the database, and displays a confirmation message.
.View_obituaries (script): This script retrieves data from the database and displays obituaries on a web page.
.Obituary_platform database: This database stores obituary data in a table named "obituaries" with specified columns.
.Documentation: This document covers the setup, development process, and application usage.

Development Steps
1. Environment Setup:
  i.  Verify your local server can be accessed and the chosen framework is installed.
  ii. Ensure the database service is running.
  iii. Create a virtual environment for the project and install necessary dependencies.

2. Database Creation:
   i. Open your database management tool and create a new database named "obituary_platform".
   ii. Create a table named "obituaries" with the following columns:
     .id (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
     .name (VARCHAR(100))
     .date_of_birth (DATE)
     .date_of_death (DATE)
     .content (TEXT)
     .author (VARCHAR(100))
     .submission_date (DATETIME, default to current timestamp)
     .slug (VARCHAR(255), Unique)
   
3. HTML Form Creation:
.Develop an HTML form named "obituary_form.html" to capture obituary details.
.Include fields for Name, Date of Birth, Date of Death, Content, and Author.
.Set the form method to POST and the action to the appropriate script for handling submissions.
.Style the form using CSS for visual appeal.
.Implement JavaScript for form validation before submission.

4. Backend Script for Data Submission:
.Create a script named "submit_obituary" (specific name depends on framework).
.Capture form data and establish a connection to the "obituary_platform" database.
.Insert the captured data into the "obituaries" table.
.Provide a confirmation message upon successful submission.
.Implement error handling for database connection issues or data insertion failures.

5. Backend Script for Data Retrieval:
.Create a script named "view_obituaries" (specific name depends on framework).
.Connect to the "obituary_platform" database and retrieve all records from the "obituaries" table.
.Display the retrieved data in an HTML table on a web page.
.Style the table using CSS for better readability.
.Implement pagination for large datasets to improve user experience.

6. SEO and Social Media Optimization:
.Add dynamic meta tags (title, description, keywords) based on obituary content.
.Utilize semantic HTML tags and structured data (schema.org) for search engine visibility.
.Implement Open Graph tags to enhance social media sharing previews.
.Integrate social media sharing buttons on obituary pages.
.Include canonical tags to avoid duplicate content issues.
.Create an XML sitemap and submit it to search engines.

7. Testing and Validation:
.Test the HTML form by submitting sample obituaries.
.Verify that data is stored correctly in the "obituaries" table.
.Access the "view_obituaries" page to ensure data retrieval and display functionality.
.Perform edge case testing to ensure proper handling of various inputs and errors.
.Test the application across different web browsers for cross-browser compatibility.

Deliverables:
.obituary_form.html
.submit_obituary script
.view_obituaries script
.obituary_platform database with the "obituaries" table
.Project documentation

Evaluation Criteria:
The project will be evaluated based on the following factors:
i. Functionality: Successful data capture, storage, and retrieval for obituaries.
ii. Code Quality: Clean, well-documented code adhering to best practices.
